# Bubble Token

[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/RXRBOwV9RNuWP3PPd3AZDw/badge)](https://hackmd.io/RXRBOwV9RNuWP3PPd3AZDw)

A social trust game.

## What is it?
The Bubble token is the center of attention of our social trust game. As it says - it's a bubble.

And you may be part of the bubble.

Technically and importantly it is an ERC20-Token with some added capabilities which are relevant to the game.

## Why do we need a Bubble Token?
Well we don't xD

But it's fun playing with artificial value as you may noticed that every value for real is more artificial in it's basic nature because the evaluation of somthing is subjective and detached of whatever we could think of as "real value" - like time, energy and ressources spent. The real economic evaluation is more like how much blackmail lever could be applied on the "sell". That's why "scarcity" works. And people would pay much for anything when they could expect it would be evaluated much more in the future.

Up until now it was moreso the priviledge of the financial industries to play this game with rather high stakes.

Now we could directly play that game without anything serious at stake. Sounds like fun? :D


## Value and the Game

Doesn't it feel very satisfying to create value?
Doesn't it feel great to contribute to a prosper, sustainable civlilization which would grant maximum freedom to all the people to furtherly develop themselves and the world around them?
Especially your children and grand-grand-grand... children?

Wondering...
- Couldn't we actually live in Utopia already if there was enough trust between the people?
- Or are there "those people" who don't understand where the value is created and kept and will just mess it up for everyone if they get the chance?

This goes hand in hand with the never-ending battle of a trusted in-group against an evil out-group. It's very much in our nature to play this game - why not play it for fun?

The trusted in-group can be very virtual. How would you trust somebody? Why is "the nice guy" a disadvantageous version?
*Well... Imagine you have this guy in your group, this "good guy" who will just throw value from the in-group to just anybody in the out-group... your tribe cannot afford this guy.*

When we reduce it all to the bubble value. We can directly relate this bubble value to what it's all about.
So the trusted in-group wold be anyone who preserves the bubble. You just don't know who it is^^...

Every player is responsible for preserving the value. 
When am I too nice - giving bubble tokens away for free to a shady friend who does not even respect me as a person and what my ideas are neither what the bubble token game is about... Well then I actually cheat myself and all my real in-group who are really with me.

Then, the evaluation from the Bubble may only happen from an outside perspective.
Because the market price pressure is directly related to the overall desire of the other people to either join and support or join and reap the bubble.

So actually the bubble token needs to be tradable to the outside to have a global evaluation. Otherwise if the bubble is only in the in-groups imagination it's not "real". "Real" it becomes only when the bubble may be exposed to the outside world of potential parasites or further valuable allies, who would buy the tokens for the current bubbled value. So it is very okay to sell some of the tokens at a time giving unknown people the chance to join.

All holders are directly responsible to keep up that fight and have the value growing. 

Everyone could act totally selfish to only play cooperatively until they got x2 - then sell out.
How much of this behaviour could we afford?

Can we trust in the collective intelligence of the cooperative players to keep up the growth?

Are you the value creator, or the sell-out? 
And who are your friends?

## The Game and the Rules

The game is very simple.

You just hold tokens and decide how you use it. Everything possible is legal and encouraged. At best we all do something with it to increase the Bubble value. 
That is the winning aim of the game - infinite sustainable growth, responsibly used and cared for by the members.

We may also collectivly loose the game, when the bubble or the system around it is destroyed.
Individually you might have your own profit or loss independent of the collective win or loose.
You may play as you whish there is no moral obligation - it's just a game.

Still - imagine you are then part of the huge Bubble of real wealth in the winning case.
Or - imagine you destroy that huge Bubble of real wealth and generate an insane amount of profit for yourself. 
Or - imagine you destroy that huge Bubble of real wealth and don't even profit for yourself xD...

### The Rules
As soon as you hold enough bubble tokens you are a fully trusted in-group Member. This value we call "Amount of Trust" (AoT).

When you are a trusted in-group Member you have the privilege to create new Tokens.
One may only create one new Token in one transaction.

On the other side there is a limit of tokens you could hodl in your wallet - the "Maximum Amount" (MA).

### Collective Parameter Regulation
These Parameters AoT or MA may be particularily important to keep the bubble up.
So those parameters could be changed.

To change the parameters, anyone with a Bubble Token could use that Bubble token to change the value by +/- 1.
If the Bubble Token is used in this way for parameter adjustment it is burned.


## Network Bootstrap
First it is encouraged to share bubble tokens with your friends whom you could trust they understand what it's all about and would not just blindly reap it. It is your responsibility to be sure of that - otherwise you are that "nice-guy-leakage" of in-group value.

This way a Network of Trust is created.

The evaluation firstly comes from a Relay Contract, in style of the Bancor Protocol - which would require people to stake their tokens as liquidity and provide an external value weight to the Bubble Tokens such, that the original evaluation of the token comes from the external value the Network is ready to weigh their bubble against.

This will start the battle. Protect the bubble!

As now anyone from within The network could sell his created Tokens to the relay. Consuming a part of the value other Network members have supplied and exposing more of the Bubble Tokens to the outside world for a cheaper price.

How will the Network react?
How would the people from the outside use their tokens they aquire?

GL and HF!
